# NFY-Staking-Platofrm
Staking platform for Non-Fungible Yearn.

Platform will open with two staking pools. NFY staking pool and NFY/ETH LP staking pool.
When a user stakes their stake will be stored in a NFT. 

There will be a different NFT for each staking pool.

ex. NFY staking NFT and NFY/ETH LP staking NFT


NFY staking has the ability to be unstaked for a 5% fee that will get distributed to the reward pool. This will incentivize trading the rights to a stake rather than unstaking. 

NFY/ETH LP staking can not be withdrawn. The rights to this stake can be traded via trading platform when released.
